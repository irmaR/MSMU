<h1>Getting and Using Python</h1>

Python can be downloaded for free <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads">here</a>.  <b>Make sure to download Version 3 of Python (as I write this the latest version is 3.6.2) rather than Version 2.</b>  After downloading, follow the instructions to install it on your machine.

<p>
Python comes with the IDLE program, which is an environment that makes it easy to write and run Python programs.  Double-click on the IDLE icon (or find the IDLE program however you find other programs on your computer, through the appropriate menus) to start it.

<p>
IDLE starts by providing you with the Python interpreter prompt <b>&gt;&gt;&gt;</b>, where you can type expressions and Python will compute and print the resulting values of these expressions.  The main aspects of IDLE that you will need to know are:

<ul>
<li>Use <i>New File</i> under the <i>File</i> menu to open an empty window for writing your code.</li>
<li>Use <i>Open...</i> under the <i>File</i> menu to open an existing file on your computer that contains Python code.</li>
<li>Use <i>Save</i> under the <i>File</i> menu to save the current Python code that you are editing to a file.</li>
<li>Use <i>Run Module</i> under the <i>Run</i> menu to load your code into the Python interpreter window.  If there are syntax errors, you will see error messages that point to parts of the code that need to be fixed.  If there are no errors, then you can now test your code by executing your functions in the interpreter window.</li>
</ul>

Many of the above commands have keyboard shortcuts, which are listed next to the commands in the menus.  You can also define your own keyboard shortcuts in the <i>Keys</i> tab of <i>Preferences...</i>, which is under the <i>IDLE</i> menu.
