# Here is one of many possible solutions:

# First move to the northeast corner of the grid
# and change to state 1
0 x*** -> N 0
0 Nx** -> E 0
0 NE** -> X 1

# Go south to cover the whole column, move west one step,
# and change to state 2
1 ***x -> S 1
1 **xS -> W 2

# Go north to cover the whole column, move west one step,
# and change to state 1
2 x*** -> N 2
2 N*xx -> W 1
