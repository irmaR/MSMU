# Here is a simple strategy that works (though is 
# relatively verbose in terms of the number of rules).

# We have one state per direction.
# In each direction we do the following:
#   If the wall is on the right, then keep going.
#   If we lose the wall then go right.
#   If we can't go straight or right, go left.
#   If we can't go straight, right or left, turn around.
