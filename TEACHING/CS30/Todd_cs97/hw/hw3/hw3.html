<h1>Homework 3</h1>

<h2>Due Monday, November 6, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Turn in your homework via the CCLE web page for our course as an updated version of the <tt>hw3.py</tt> and <tt>hw3_turtle.py</tt> files that I have provided.   <b>Make sure to use exactly these file names!</b>

<h3>Make sure that each file can be executed without any syntax or other errors into the Python interpreter; otherwise you will get a 0 on that part of the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS97 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.  You can list that as a comment at the top of the <tt>hw3.py</tt> file.</h3>

Test your code on several inputs, including special cases --
we will be doing the same.  

<p><b><i>IMPORTANT RULES!</i> Do not use any Python libraries other than <tt>turtle</tt> (needed for the second problem below).  Do not use any built-in functions of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  Do not use any language features of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  If in doubt, ask!</b>

<p>
Now on to the assignment!

<h3>Problem #1:  Counting and Sorting</h3>

<ol type="a">
<li> Write a function <tt>partition</tt> that accepts a 
	value <tt>v</tt> and a list <tt>l</tt> and partitions <tt>l</tt> into a list of elements that are equal to <tt>v</tt> and a list of all other elements. For example, <tt>partition(2, [1,5,3,2,2,1,3,2])</tt> returns <tt>[[2,2,2], [1,5,3,1,3]]</tt>.  Note that the result of <tt>partition</tt> should always be <i>a list that contains exactly two lists</i>.<p></li>

<li>Write a function <tt>countDistinct</tt> that accepts a list <tt>l</tt> and returns the number of distinct elements in the list. For example, <tt>countDistinct([1,5,3,2,2,1,3,2])</tt> returns <tt>4</tt>.  The <tt>partition</tt> function you wrote above will be a useful helper function for this task, since partitioning a list on its first element has the effect of removing all occurrences of that element from the list.<p></p></li>

<li><i>Sorting</i> is a fundamental task in computer science.  For example, given a list of CS97 students, for various purposes I may want to sort them in alphabetical order, sort them in order of their grade in the class, etc.  The <tt>partition</tt> function you wrote above can be used to implement a simple form of sorting known as <i>selection sort</i>.  Implement a function <tt>selectionSort</tt> that takes a list and returns a list containing the same elements but sorted from least to greatest.  For example, <tt>selectionSort([1,5,3,2,2,1,3,2])</tt> returns <tt>[1,1,2,2,2,3,3,5]</tt>.  

<p>Selection sort conceptually works as follows.  First obtain the minimum element of the list (Python's <tt>min</tt> function will be just the thing for this) --- in our example above the minimum element is <tt>1</tt>.  Then <tt>partition</tt> the list based on this minimum value --- in our example this produces <tt>[[1,1], [5,3,2,2,3,2]]</tt>.  Finally, use recursion to sort the elements other than the miniumum value (in our example that would produce <tt>[2,2,2,3,3,5]</tt>), and then combine that result with the minimum elements to obtain the desired result.  
You can see an example execution of a similar selection sort approach <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selection_sort#Example">here</a> (though the implementation style that is discussed there does not use recursion and so should not be copied, or you'll get no credit!).</p><p></p></li>

<li> Another, more efficient, form of sorting is known as <i>merge sort</i>.  Implement a function <tt>mergeSort</tt> that takes a list and returns a list containing the same elements but sorted from least to greatest.  For example, <tt>mergeSort([1,2,2,1,5,3,1,2])</tt> returns <tt>[1,1,1,2,2,2,3,5]</tt>.  
Merge sort uses the <tt>merge</tt> function from the previous homework, which I have provided in <tt>hw3.py</tt>.  The algorithm conceptually works as follows.  First, split the list into two equal (or in the case of an odd number of elements, close to equal) size lists --- in our example this produces <tt>[1,5,3,2]</tt> and <tt>[2,1,3,2]</tt>. Then recursively sort each of these lists --- in our example this produces <tt>[1,2,3,5]</tt> and <tt>[1,2,2,3]</tt>.  Finally <tt>merge</tt> the resulting lists to obtain the full sorted list.
You can see an animation of merge sort in action on the right-hand side of the page <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort">here</a>.<p></p></p></li>

<h3>Problem #2:  Drawing a tree</h3>

Finally, use the <tt>turtle</tt> library to write a function <tt>tree</tt> that draws a tree.  The file <tt>hw3_turtle.py</tt> contains the correct code for <tt>tree</tt>, but most of the work is done by the <tt>sidewaysTree</tt> function, which you have to implement.  That function is called <tt>sidewaysTree</tt> because on its own it will draw a tree sideways, but the <tt>tree</tt> function reorients the turtle facing north before calling <tt>sidewaysTree</tt>, ensuring that the tree will be drawn in the proper direction.

<p>The <tt>tree</tt> function takes three arguments:  <tt>trunkLength</tt>, which is the length of the first line drawn; <tt>angle</tt>, which is the angle to turn before drawing a branch; and <tt>levels</tt>, which bounds the amount of recursion.  For example, here is the result of <tt>tree(128, 30, 6)</tt>:

<p><img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/cs97/tree.png" width=300>

<p>The <tt>sidewaysTree</tt> function takes the same three arguments as <tt>tree</tt>.  Conceptually it works as follows.  If <tt>levels</tt> is 0 then we're done.  Otherwise, do the following:  1) Draw a line segment of length <tt>trunkLength</tt>; 2) Turn left by <tt>angle</tt> and recurse, cutting <tt>trunkLeft</tt> in half and decrementing <tt>levels</tt> by one; 3) Now turn right by <tt>angle</tt> <i>relative to where the turtle was pointing originally</i> (use the <tt>right</tt> function from <tt>turtle</tt>) and recurse in the same way as described in #2 above; 4) Finally, move the turtle back to where it began and pointing in the same direction as when it began (the <tt>backward</tt> function from <tt>turtle</tt> may be useful).

<p>Step 4 above may seem unnecessary but is actually <b>crucial</b>.  The fact that the turtle ends up where it starts allows each of the two recursive calls in the body of <tt>sidewaysTree</tt> to be independent of one another.  In particular, after the left branch is drawn, we know where the turtle is and so can draw the right branch appropriately.  Try skipping step 4 above and see what happens!
