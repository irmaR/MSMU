<h1>Homework 4</h1>

<h2>Due Monday, November 13, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Turn in your homework via the CCLE web page for our course as an updated version of the <tt>hw4.py</tt> file that I have provided.   <b>Make sure to use exactly this file name!</b>

<h3>Make sure that the file can be executed without any syntax or other errors into the Python interpreter; otherwise you will get a 0 on the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS97 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.  You can list that as a comment at the top of the <tt>hw4.py</tt> file.</h3>

<h3>The Assignment</h3>

The file <tt>hw4.py</tt> contains definitions of six Python functions that you must implement.  <b>Here are the rules you must follow:</b>

<ol>
	<li>
		 The only function in <tt>hw4.py</tt> that is allowed to use recursion in this
		 entire assignment is <tt>map2</tt>.   ALSO MAKE CLEAR THAT MAP2 CANNOT USE MAP - TURNS OUT THAT PYTHON's MAP DOES MAP2 WHEN PASSED MULTIPLE LISTS
		 <b><i>All other functions (including any helper functions you write) must not be recursive.</i></b>  Instead, they should make calls to one or more of <tt>map</tt>, <tt>filter</tt>, and/or <tt>reduce</tt> to perform the necessary list traversals.<p></p></li>

	<li>Do not use any function from Python libraries other than <tt>reduce</tt> (from the <tt>functools</tt> library).  Do not use any built-in functions of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  Do not use any language features of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  If in doubt, ask!<p></p></li>
</ol>
