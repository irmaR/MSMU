<h1>Homework 2</h1>

<h2>Due Monday, October 23, at 11:30pm</h2>

<h3>Turn in your homework via the CCLE web page for our course as an updated version of the <tt>hw2.py</tt> and <tt>hw2_turtle.py</tt> files that I have provided.   <b>Make sure to use exactly these file names!</b>

<h3>Make sure that each file can be executed without any syntax or other errors into the Python interpreter; otherwise you will get a 0 on that part of the homework!</h3>

<h3>Recall the CS97 Academic Honesty Policy!  You must list whom you
discussed the assignment with at the top of your assignment, and also what
other resources you used.  You can list that as a comment at the top of the <tt>hw2.py</tt> file.</h3>

In this assignment you'll get practice writing recursive functions in Python.
Test your code on several inputs, including special cases --
we will be doing the same.  I have included code in <tt>hw2.py</tt> to automatically run tests that are written in docstrings using the <tt>doctest</tt> library that was shown in class (see the notes for October 9).  For example, here is a function with a single test:

<p><tt>def square(x):<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""Squares its argument.<br><br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;>>> square(3)<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"""<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return x * x
</tt>

<p><b><i>IMPORTANT RULES!</i> Do not use any Python libraries other than <tt>turtle</tt> (needed for the second problem below).  Do not use any built-in functions of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  Do not use any language features of Python that have not been discussed in lecture.  If in doubt, ask!</b>

<p>
Now on to the assignment!

<h3>Problem #1:  Manipulating Lists</h3>

These problems should each be solved by writing a single, recursive function.  <b><i>ANOTHER IMPORTANT RULE!</i> You may not define any helper functions for this part of the assignment -- the answer to each problem should be a single recursive function</b>.

<ol type="a">
<li> Write a function <tt>doubleAll</tt> that accepts an integer list <tt>l</tt> and returns a new list that is identical to <tt>l</tt> but with each value doubled.  For example, <tt>doubleAll([1,2,3])</tt> returns <tt>[2,4,6]</tt>.<p></li>

<li> Write a function <tt>countPos</tt> that accepts an integer list <tt>l</tt> and returns the number of elements of the list that are positive.  For example, <tt>countPos([1, -4, 0, 4, 8, 0])</tt> returns <tt>3</tt>.<p></li>

<li> Write a function <tt>intRange</tt> that accepts two integers <tt>low</tt> and <tt>high</tt> and returns a list of all integers in the range between <tt>low</tt> and <tt>high</tt> inclusive.  For example, <tt>intRange(2, 5)</tt> returns <tt>[2,3,4,5]</tt>.<p></p></li>

<li>Write a function <tt>merge</tt> that accepts two integer lists <tt>l1</tt> and <tt>l2</tt> that are each sorted from least to greatest and produces a new list that contains the elements of both lists, also sorted from least to greatest.  Note that duplicates are allowed, both within and across lists.  For example, <tt>merge([1,2,4], [2,3,3,5])</tt> returns <tt>[1,2,2,3,3,4,5]</tt>.<p></li>
</ol>


<h3>Problem #2:  Turtle Graphics</h3>

<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics">Turtle graphics</a> is a simple, fun, and powerful way to write programs that draw shapes.  The program simply commands a turtle to move around a canvas, and the path of the turtle is the shape that is drawn.  Python has a library called <tt>turtle</tt> that supports turtle graphics.  You can see its documentation <a href="https://docs.python.org/3.3/library/turtle.html">here</a>.  

<p>There are lots of commands, but we will only be using two of them:  <tt>forward(d)</tt> moves the turtle forward for distance <tt>d</tt> (a number), and <tt>left(a)</tt> turns the turtle left by <tt>a</tt> degrees.  We will play a bit with these commands in class on Wednesday, but it's easy to try yourself!	 When you enter one of these commands at the Python prompt, you should see a canvas window open up, and the path of the turtle will be drawn.

<p><b><i>A FINAL IMPORTANT RULE!</i> These problems should only use two functions from the <tt>turtle</tt> library:  <tt>forward</tt> and <tt>left</tt>.</b>  During testing, you can use the <tt>reset()</tt> function to clear the canvas.

<ol type="a">
<li>A <i>regular polygon</i> is a polygon where all sides have equal length and all angles have equal measure.  Write a function <tt>regularNGon</tt> that takes a positive integer <tt>n</tt> and a positive number (which need not be an integer) <tt>sideLength</tt> and draws a regular <tt>n</tt>-gon where each side has length <tt>sideLength</tt>.  <i>Hint: It will be useful to define another function that <tt>regularNGon</tt> calls and that does most of the work.</i>

<p>For example, <tt>regularNGon(8, 100)</tt> produces the following shape:

	<p><img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/cs97/octagon.png" width=300>
<p></p></li>

<li>Write a function <tt>archSpiral</tt> that draws an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archimedean_spiral">Archimedean spiral</a>.  The function takes four positive numbers, <tt>initialLen</tt>, <tt>increment</tt>, <tt>angle</tt>, and <tt>n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> must be an integer.  Conceptually, the spiral should be drawn by doing the following sequence <tt>n</tt> times:  1) Draw a line segment of length <tt>initialLen</tt>.  2) Turn left by <tt>angle</tt> degrees.  3) Increment <tt>initialLen</tt> by <tt>increment</tt>.  Of course, this should be implemented as a recursive function.

<p>For example, <tt>archSpiral(1, 0.5, 30, 100)</tt> produces the following shape:

	<p><img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/cs97/archSpiral.png" width=300>
<p></p></li>

<li>Write a function <tt>logSpiral</tt> that draws a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logarithmic_spiral">logarithmic spiral</a>.  The function takes four positive numbers, <tt>initialLen</tt>, <tt>percentIncrease</tt>, <tt>angle</tt>, and <tt>n</tt>, where <tt>n</tt> must be an integer.  The only difference from the Archimedean spiral above is that at each iteration, the value of <tt>initialLen</tt> should be increased by the percentage specified in <tt>percentIncrease</tt>.

<p>For example, <tt>logSpiral(1, 4, 30, 120)</tt> produces the following shape:

	<p><img src="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd/cs97/logSpiral.png" width=300>
