<h1>UCLA Computer Science 97: Principles and Practices of Computing</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>

This course is intended for students who do not have prior programming experience, as a precursor to the existing introductory course sequence (CS31, CS32, and CS33).  The course aims to illustrate the power and fun of computing through a variety of applications.  It also aims to teach students how to use computers as a tool for problem solving, creativity, and exploration via the design and implementation of computer programs.

<p>
CS97 will use the popular Python programming language as a vehicle for introducing students to programming and the broader field of computing.  Students will learn how to design, implement, and test programs that solve computational problems.  Key concepts learned will include:

<ul>
<li>functional decomposition: the ability to break a task into an appropriate set of subtasks, each implemented as a function</li>
<li>usage of common data types: integers, booleans, strings, and lists and similar container data structures</li>
<li>usage of common control structures: conditionals and loops</li>
</ul>

<h2>Should you take CS97 or CS31?</h2>

Due to the introduction of CS97, <b>CS31 will assume that students have prior experience with the above concepts in some programming language.</b>  You should enroll in CS31 only if you have written the following in any programming language:

<ul>
<li>
a program using an array (or ArrayList or vector or list or any other sequence container) and, as the same or a different program,</li>
<li>a program in which you called a function (or method) that you wrote that accepts one or more parameters (or arguments).</li>
</ul>

Otherwise, you should enroll in CS97 in Fall and plan to take CS31 in Winter.


<h2>Logistics</h2>

All of the course information and materials are available on the <a
href="https://ccle.ucla.edu/course/view/17F-COMSCI97-1">CS97
homepage</a>.  You must login using your BOL account in
order to gain full access to the materials.

<p> The instructor is <a href="http://www.cs.ucla.edu/~todd">Todd
Millstein</a>.  The graduate teaching assistants (TAs) are Lun Liu and Lana Ramjit.  The undergraduate learning assistants (LAs) are Daniel Guo, Dennis van Ee, Anirudh Veeraragavan, and Matthew Wong.


<h2>Getting Help</h2>

We will be using Piazza as our class forum.  You should sign up for the forum <a href="https://piazza.com/ucla/fall2017/cs97">here</a>.

<p>
If you have a general question that other students may be able to answer and/or could benefit from
knowing the answer to, you should ask it on Piazza.  Of course, you should never post
anything that gives away part of your answers to an assignment or violates our academic integrity policy (see below)
in any way.
For example, <b>posting your code is never allowed</b>.  If in doubt,
don't post.

<p> If you have a specific question about your work you should attend
either my or a TA's office hours.  If for some reason you cannot
attend office hours, then you can send a "private note" to the instructors on Piazza.

<h2>Text</h2>

We will be using the online book <a href="https://www.cs.hmc.edu/csforall">CS For All</a>.  Readings will be assigned from this book throughout the quarter.
   
<h2>Homework</h2>

Programming assignments constitute the majority of the course workload,
and they are the primary means by which you actually learn the
concepts taught in lecture.


<h2>Late Policy</h2>

You can turn in each homework up to 3 days late for partial credit.
If your score would normally be S, then being 1 day late will make your score S * 0.9,
being 2 days late will make your score S * 0.7, and being 3 days late will make your score S * 0.5.

<b>One second late is equivalent to 23
hours, 59 minutes, and 59 seconds late -- both cost one late day.</b>

<h2>Grading</h2>

<ul>
<li>homeworks: 40%</li>
<li>midterm exam 1: 15%</li>
<li>midterm exam 2: 15%</li>
<li>final exam: 30%</li>
</ul>

The first midterm exam will be in class on Wednesday, October 25.  The second midterm exam will be in class on Wednesday, November 15.  The final exam will be on Thursday, December 14 at 8am.

<h2>Academic Integrity</h2>

I trust you, and I take violations of this trust quite seriously.
Both SEAS and the university as a whole have strict policies on
academic integrity.  Our course additionally has its own policy on academic
honesty, which can be found on the course web page.
<b>We will adhere to these policies strictly.</b>

<h2>CAPS</h2>

UCLA Counseling and Psychological Services (CAPS) provides mental health care and resources for all registered students, including short-term individual and/or group treatment, urgent services and referrals when needed.  Your well-being is the #1 priority of UCLA CAPS. Counselors are available by phone at (310) 825-0768  24/7. Learn more at
